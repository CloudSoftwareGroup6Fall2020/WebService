# Semester Project for SWE4633 Fall 2020
This project is a flask based web service that uses a RESTful API to send and receive images. Mostly cat images.<br>

It's hosted on Azure and can be found <a href="https://cloudsoftwareprojectgroup6.azurewebsites.net/">here</a>.
The API is hosted on Azure as well and its Swagger based specification can be found <a href="http://cloudsoftwareprojectgroup6api.azurewebsites.net/swagger/">here</a>.<br>
It might take a while to load since I only have the basic Azure plan. Have fun!
